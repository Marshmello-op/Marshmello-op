Come on over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into Heaven, yeah

My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me, tailor-made love, how you put it on

Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby take it slow so we can last long

### ==================================

Tu mile dil khile
Aur jine ko kya chahiye
Tu mile dil khile
Aur jine ko kya chahiye


Na ho tu udas tere pas pas
Main rahunga zindagi bhar
Na ho tu udas tere pas pas
Main rahunga zindagi bhar
Sare sansar ka pyar maine
Tujhi me paya
